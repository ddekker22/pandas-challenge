Module 4 Assignment: PyCitySchools

This python code analyzes math and reading scores among students within a district of 15 schools. The analysis includes summaries of the datasets and a written analysis of the trends. 

All the code for the module came from class exercises, but I used StackOverflow to review some of the principles in greater depth, including the set_index function.
